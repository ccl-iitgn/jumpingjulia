# 🐸 Jumping Julia

**Jumping Julia** is an interactive web-based puzzle game where the player controls Julia — a frog-like character who can jump in specific patterns. The goal is to find a valid sequence of jumps that moves Julia from her starting position to the target location, while obeying puzzle-specific movement constraints.

The game is designed to challenge spatial thinking, constraint satisfaction, and strategic planning.
